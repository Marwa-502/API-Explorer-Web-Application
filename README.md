# API Explorer Web Application - Friday, November 3rd Assignment

This assignment posed numerous challenges for me. Although it is still not functioning perfectly, I believe the issues primarily stem from the API I am using. Initially, I attempted to utilize the booklist from Google, but it proved to be too complex. To overcome this, I opted to create my own personal bookshelf on Google to manage data saving and deletion. This required special authorization, prompting me to make adjustments.

In an effort to streamline the assignment and focus more on the API aspect, I explored using Bootstrap. However, this presented a challenge as we have not extensively covered Bootstrap in class yet.

This brings me to my current predicament. I decided to retrieve data from TMDB, creating an account and obtaining my API key and authentication. While this worked well for most of the assignment, there appeared to be a lag between data retrieval and saving. Towards the end of the assignment, I shifted to using MockAPI due to persistent issues with TMDB. Unfortunately, after making this switch, I found myself locked out of the TMDB list I was using.

In light of these challenges, I have chosen to move on and concentrate on my other assignments, submitting this project in its current state. I hope to be judged on the coding rather than the functionality of the code. Despite occasional issues with data retrieval and deletion from the server, the code worked for a significant portion of the assignment.

I used a variety of resources to help me develop my code. TMDB also provided examples of code that worked with their server when making requests. I utilized youtube, npmjs.com, google and ChatGPT to understand the how to structure my code and where my errors were, especially concerning the inability to save and delete items when using TMDB's API. When I shifted gears to using MockAPI, I used ChatGPT to help me identify where I could insert console.logs to pinpoint the issues I was encountering. Unfortunately i had to decide to just move on to the next assignment.
